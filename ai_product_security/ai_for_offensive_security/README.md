# AI for Offensive Security
Offensive security go through the following phases:
1. Reconnaissance - information related to the target is collected through publicly available data sources and passive reconnaissance techniques (e.g. collecting information of employees to launch a BEC attack). AI can be used to automate the collection of OSINT, summerize fundings and plan adaptive reconnaissance techniques. 
2. Scanning - this phase probes systems to map targets, networks and vulnerabilities. AI can analyze network patterns and identify vulnerabilies and map them to network resources.
3. Vulnerability analysis - based on the output from the scanning, this phase focuses on prioritizing security risks based on their impact and severity, which AI can help.
4. Exploitation - identified security weaknesses are tested by launching simulated attacks under controlled conditions. AI can help generate simulated attacks.
5. Reporting - offensive security findings are summerized where LLMs can play a big role.
