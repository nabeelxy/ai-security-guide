| Sep 2024 | From Deception to Detection: The Dual Roles of Large Language Models in Fake News | arXiv | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17416) | Fake News, Disinformation, LLM, AI-generated content | Two questions: Can LLMs generate fake news? Can LLM be used to detect fake news? They found that models like C4AI, Zephyr-orpo and Mistral showed no hesistant of generating fake news. However, models like GPT-4, Gemma-1.1 and Phi-3 were hesitant to or didn't generate fake news due to extensive safety protocols in place. In terms of detection capabilities, Llama-3 and Zephyr-orpo demonstrated superior performance in detecting human generated fake news, whereas GPT-4 and Gemma-1.1 showed better detection performance in detecting LLM generated fake news. | |
