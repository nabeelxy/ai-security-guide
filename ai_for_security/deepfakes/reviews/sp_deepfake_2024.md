# An analysis of recent advances in deepfake image detection in an evolving threat landscape

## Summary
They show how 8 state-of-the-art image deepfake detectors fall short due to two reasons: 1. The emergence of lightweight methods to costomize large generative models enables attackers to create many customized generators and existing defenses do not generlize to these customized ones. 2. The emergence of vision foundation models that are adopted for downstream tasks evading existing defenses. They also propose a content agnostic approach to detect deepfakes. Further, a simple adversarial attack without adding any adversarial noise through careful semantic manipulation of the image content.
