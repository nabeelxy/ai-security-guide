# From Deception to Detection: The Dual Roles of Large Language Models in Fake News

## Summary
Two questions: Can LLMs generate fake news? Can LLM be used to detect fake news? They found that models like C4AI, Zephyr-orpo and Mistral showed no hesistant of generating fake news. However, models like GPT-4, Gemma-1.1 and Phi-3 were hesitant to or didn't generate fake news due to extensive safety protocols in place. In terms of detection capabilities, Llama-3 and Zephyr-orpo demonstrated superior performance in detecting human generated fake news, whereas GPT-4 and Gemma-1.1 showed better detection performance in detecting LLM generated fake news.
