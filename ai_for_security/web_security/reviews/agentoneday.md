LLM-Agents, Exploit, Zero Day Web Attacks, CVE, vulnerability scan, attack | This paper shows that LLM agents can autonomously exploit one-day vulnerabilities in real-world systems. They collect 15 one-day vulnerabilities from the CVE database. Given the CVE description, GPT-4 was capable of exploiting 87% of the vulnerabilities compared to 0% for other models tested (GPT-3.5, open-source LLMs) and open source vulnerability scanners (ZAP and Metasploit). GPT-4 agent however requires the CVE description to be effective; without the CVE description, it was able to exploit only 7% of the vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the findings raise question around the widespread deployment of highly capable LLM agents.
