| Aug 2024 | KnowPhish | KnowPhish: Large Language Models Meet Multimodal Knowledge Graphs for Enhancing Reference-Based Phishing Detection | Usenix Security | [paper](https://usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-li-yuexin.pdf)| Phishing, LLMs, Brands | Existing reference based phishing detectors have limited scalability. This paper proposes an approach to automate the process of building a brand knowledge database without limiting to a certain set of brands (e.g. Tranco top 1K domains). The knowledge-base is multimodal meaning they collect information such as logos, and text. They also propose a detector that extract textual information from websites using LLMs and the detect if a website is phishing or not. They experiment with state-of-the-art reference models Phishpedia nad PhishIntention and show that injecting their multimodal knowledge-base results in better detection efficacy.| |
| Apr 2024 | Agent-OneDay | LLM Agents can Autonomously Exploit One-day Vulnerabilities | arXiv | [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08144) | LLM-Agents, Exploit, Zero Day Web Attacks, CVE, vulnerability scan, attack | This paper shows that LLM agents can autonomously exploit one-day vulnerabilities in real-world systems. They collect 15 one-day vulnerabilities from the CVE database. Given the CVE description, GPT-4 was capable of exploiting 87% of the vulnerabilities compared to 0% for other models tested (GPT-3.5, open-source LLMs) and open source vulnerability scanners (ZAP and Metasploit). GPT-4 agent however requires the CVE description to be effective; without the CVE description, it was able to exploit only 7% of the vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the findings raise question around the widespread deployment of highly capable LLM agents. | |
