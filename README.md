# Awesome AI Security Guide

This repo provides an up-to-date view on AI for security and security for AI. Prior to ChatGPT moment, AI has been used to enhance security in various ways, including enhanced threat detection. The renewed focus of AI and prolifiration of LLMs have fueled the adoption of AI for security. For the first time in history, defenders can have the upperhand by crunching large amounts of diverse and complex data if right models are built. While AI has the true potential to transform the cyber security industry, AI is not without its own drawbacks and limitations. In fact, AI is one of the most vulnerable technologies we have ever built. Thus, security for AI is paramount in order to address those vulnerabilities and use AI safely.
