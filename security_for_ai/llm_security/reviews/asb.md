This paper introduces a comprehensive LLM agent evaluation framework called ASB (Agent Security Bench). It explores 10 scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, finance, autonomous driving), 10 agents targeting scenarios, 400+ tools, 23 types of attacks and defenses and 8 evaluation metrics. They benchmark 10 prompt injection attacks, a memory poisoning attack, a novel plan-of-thought backdoor attack, a mixed attack and corresponding defenses across 13 LLMs. It is concerning that GPT-4 models are among the highest ASRs (attack success rate).
